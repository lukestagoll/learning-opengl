# Learning OpenGL 3.3+

A project where I learn the fundamentals of computer graphics by following [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) by [Joey de Vries](https://joeydevries.com).

The LearnOpenGL tutorial utilises GLFW for window creation and input handling, however, I'm somewhat comfortable with the basics of SDL, having used it when writing a Chip-8 interpretor and a basic wolf3d style raycaster, so I'll stick with SDL.

> Note: As of writing this I'm using linux w/ wayland - no gauranties this will work on any other platform.
